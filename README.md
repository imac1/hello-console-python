# Hello, Console!

## Story

Let's open up your "Hello" program to communicate with the outer World.

## What are you going to learn?

- Call programs from command line with arguments.
- Import a built-in module.
- Handle list contents.

## Tasks

1. Modify `hello.py` to greet the name or names given after the name of the script at the prompt. Running the script with no arguments still prints `"Hello, World!"`
    - Running `python3 hello.py Joe` writes `"Hello, Joe!"` to the console.
    - Running `python3 hello.py Cotton Eye Joe` writes `"Hello, Cotton Eye Joe!"`.
    - Running `python3 hello.py` writes `Hello, World!` to the console.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Python gives access to the command line arguments through the built-in `sys.argv` list (see the first linked background material). Use indexing, slicing, and joining to access and effectively manipulate the contents of this list (see the other two linked materials).

## Background materials

- [Command line arguments in Python](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/command-line-arguments-in-python)
- [Slicing sequences](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-slice-usage/)
- [Joining list elements](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/join-function-python/)
